PRESS SPACE TO BEGIN ANIMATION/MUSIC

For this assignment, I decided the ending scene to Breaking Bad (Spoiler Alert): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9RP-KfvdKc

<br>
I was able to make 6 spotlights for the lab, a directional light to simualte the sun, and 2 lights for the police vehicle (red and blue) that alternate to look realistic. I also did the camera pan out and rotate out like how the actual show does it.

After about 1-2 minutes of the "animation", you are able to use orbit controls to look around. (Apologies if that's too long, I thought it was the right amount for what I was trying to make).
I would have liked to put more detail/effort on it as some textures are not properly scaled/mapped because I was running low on time. However, I did have lots of fun working on this final assignment!
